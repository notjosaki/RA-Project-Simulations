# AR Physics Simulations
This augmented reality (AR) project enables the interactive visualization and simulation of physical effects in real-world environments using advanced AR technologies. The main goal is to integrate realistic simulations of physical phenomena, such as gravity, object collisions, and dynamic forces, into an interactive and accessible experience.

Features:
Real-time physics simulation: Accurate modeling of forces like gravity, friction, and collisions.
AR interaction: Users can interact with simulated objects through gestures and real-world movements.
Dynamic visual effects: High-quality rendering to show interactions between objects and their surroundings.
